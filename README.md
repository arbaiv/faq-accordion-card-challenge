## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JQuery - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to add linear-gradient to the whole body. Also, how to position an SVG out of the parent element without breaking the grid.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about positioning SVG's and adding multiple animations. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10487292/position-absolute-but-relative-to-parent) - I was having trouble positioning the Illustration box in the required place. I needed to put position absolute but relative to the parent and not the window. This solution helped me to do that.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34108433/html-css-linear-gradient-not-taking-up-full-screen) - The linear-gradient was not taking up the full-screen height.
